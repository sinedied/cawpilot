# Fork a repo
gh repo fork <owner/repo> [--clone]

# Delete a repo (use with caution)
gh repo delete <owner/repo> --yes
```

gh label delete "name" [-R owner/repo] --yes

# Milestones (via API)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones --jq '.[].title'
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones -f title="v1.0" -f due_on="2026-06-01T00:00:00Z"
```

### Workflow / CI

```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list [-R owner/repo] [--workflow "ci.yml"]

```

## Important Rules

- **Always use `-R owner/repo`** when operating on a repo other than the current working directory's repo.
- **Branch safety**: When creating PRs for CawPilot-managed code changes, always use `caw-*` branch prefix.
- **Confirm destructive operations**: Before deleting repos, closing issues, or merging PRs, confirm with the user first.
- **Use `--json` for structured output** when you need to parse results programmatically:
  ```bash
  gh issue list --json number,title,state,labels
  gh pr list --json number,title,state,headRefName
  ```
- **Use `--jq` for filtering** JSON output directly:
  ```bash
  gh issue list --json number,title --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
  ```
- **Pagination**: For large result sets, use `--limit` or `--paginate` to control output.
- **PR titles from CawPilot**: Use format `[CawPilot] <description>` when creating PRs on behalf of the bot.

## Examples

User: "What are the open bugs in my-app repo?"
→ `gh issue list -R owner/my-app --label "bug" --state open --json number,title,assignees`

User: "Create an issue for the login timeout problem"
→ `gh issue create -R owner/my-app --title "Login timeout on slow connections" --body "..." --label "bug"`

User: "Review the latest PR"
→ `gh pr list -R owner/my-app --state open --limit 1 --json number,title` → `gh pr view <number>` → `gh pr diff <number>`

User: "What's the CI status on PR #42?"
→ `gh pr checks 42 -R owner/my-app`

User: "Merge PR #42 with squash"
→ Confirm with user → `gh pr merge 42 -R owner/my-app --squash --delete-branch`
